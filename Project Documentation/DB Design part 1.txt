we need to create a service that will enable us to contact our database that is up and running (https://medium.com/@lk.snatch/jar-file-as-windows-service-bonus-jar-to-exe-1b7b179053e4)

select port through which you can make requests and start communicating with it (65000)

run jar files remotely (ssh remote@machine.com 'java -jar hellofile.jar') (https://stackoverflow.com/questions/34395168/execute-jar-file-from-remote-machine-in-java)

GDD format (gdd.tsv)
----------
Username~DatabaseName




write logic to store the information in the above format and create a file inside the user directory (extension .tsv)

write logic to check if the user is trying to access the local or global database




when selecting the database, we need to check which virtual machines should be selected for the data processing

request forwarder : use database query only (username and databasename)
	- send request to check the database availability (on success, we will let user know that the database is available)
	- send request for query processing on remote database (username, databasename, query)
	- table queries handling api should be written to help hardee and manali (interface)

request handler (waiting for requests)
	- checker to check if the requested database is available or not (if available, choose it)
	- query handler(username, databasename, query) - normal query handler)

2 services - send and receive






create global data dictionary as at the time of creation of user so you can append the data to the file when the database is created later on




only one session from one virtual machine
